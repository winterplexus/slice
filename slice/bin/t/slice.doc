NAME

  slice - slice text files into smaller, equal size text files

SYNOPSIS

  slice (options)

DESCRIPTION

  slice is designed to slice a text file into smaller text files based on the
  chunk size (which is a unit of 1024 bytes).

FLAGS

  -i  [input file name]
  -o  [output file path]
  -c  [chunk size (units of 1024 bytes)]
  -s  show file names
  -v  display version

  Each smaller text file sliced from the input file will have the original file
  name plus a period and part number (4 digits in length with leading zeroes).

  If output file path is not specified then input file path is used in place of
  output file path.

  If chunk size is not specified then the default chunk size is 1000 (units of
  1024 bytes). This means that each smaller text file sliced from the input file
  will not exceed 1,024,000 bytes.
