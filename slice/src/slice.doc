NAME

  slice - slice file into smaller chunks or smaller equal sized part files

SYNOPSIS

  slice (options)

DESCRIPTION

  slice is designed to slice a file into smaller equal sized chunks or into
  smaller equal sized parts files and the last chunks or parts file size may not
  match the first chunks or parts file size.

  Each smaller file sliced from the input file is stored in the outout file path
  as the input file base name plus a period and a sequence number (4 digits with
  leading zeroes).

  The sequence number begins at 0001.

  The default chunk size is 4096 bytes.

  If output file path is not specified then input file path is used in place of
  output file path.

  If chunks count is not specified then default chunks count is 1024 and the
  file will be sliced into chunks.

  If the parts file size is not a whole number then the parts file size will be
  rounded up to the next whole number.

FLAGS

  -i  [input file name]
  -o  [output file path]
  -c  [slice into n chunks (each chunk is 4096 bytes]
  -p  [slice into n parts]
  -s  show file names
  -h  display usage
  -v  display version
