NAME

  slice - slice file into smaller chunks or smaller equal sized part files

SYNOPSIS

  slice (options)

DESCRIPTION

  slice is designed to slice a file into smaller equal-sized chunks or into 
  smaller equal-sized parts files and the last chunks or parts file size may not 
  match the first chunks or parts file size.

  Each smaller file sliced from the input file is stored in the output file path 
  as the input file base name plus a period and a sequence number (4 digits with  
  leading zeroes).

  The sequence number begins at 0001.

  The default chunk size is 4096 bytes.

  If the output file path is not specified, then the input file path is used in 
  place of the output file path.
  
  If the chunk count is not specified, then the default chunk count is 1024 and
  the file will be sliced into chunks.

  If the parts file size is not a whole number, then the parts file size will be 
  rounded up to the next whole number.

OPTIONS

  -i <input file path>
  -o <output file path>
  -c <slice into n chunks (each chunk is 4096 bytes]
  -p <slice into n parts>
  -s show file names
  -v display version
