Slice Application
=================

Slice is an application that will slice a text file into smaller text files based on the chunk size (which is a unit of 1024 bytes). Each smaller text file sliced from the input file will have the original file name plus a period and part number (4 digits in length with leading zeroes).

The application defaults are:

* input file path is used in place of output file path

* chunk size is 1000

The applications are written in the C language for both Windows and Linux operating systems.
